# Technical Documentation: Facts and Dimensions

## Introduction

In data warehousing, organizing and analyzing large volumes of data effectively is crucial for gaining insights and making informed decisions. To achieve this, we use a combination of fact tables and dimension tablesâ€”two fundamental components of a data warehouse schema. This document aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of these components, their purposes, and their logical structures, specifically in the context of capturing user interactions and events.

### What Are Fact Tables?

Fact tables are the backbone of a data warehouse, designed to store quantitative data that can be analyzed and aggregated. These tables capture specific events or transactions that occur within a system. Each row in a fact table corresponds to a single event or transaction, and the table consists of two main types of columns:
- **Measures**: Numeric data that can be summed, averaged, or otherwise aggregated. In this context, measures might include counts of successful authentications, duration of listening events, and counts of page views.
- **Foreign Keys**: References to dimension tables, which provide additional context to the measures. These keys allow us to join fact tables with dimension tables and enrich the analysis with descriptive information, such as user details or location.

### What Are Dimension Tables?

Dimension tables complement fact tables by providing descriptive context to the quantitative data. They contain attributes that describe the dimensions of the events or transactions stored in the fact tables. Each row in a dimension table corresponds to a unique instance of a particular dimension, such as a specific user, location, or time period. Dimension tables typically have:
- **Primary Key**: A unique identifier for each dimension instance. This key is used to join dimension tables with fact tables.
- **Descriptive Attributes**: Columns that provide additional information about the dimension. For example, a user dimension table might include attributes like first name, last name, gender, and subscription level.

### Why Use Facts and Dimensions?

The combination of fact and dimension tables enables a multi-dimensional view of data, often referred to as a "star schema" or "snowflake schema." This approach offers several benefits:
1. **Efficiency**: By separating quantitative data (facts) from descriptive data (dimensions), storage can be optimized, and query performance can be improved.
2. **Flexibility**: Dimension tables allow the addition of new descriptive attributes without modifying the fact tables, making it easier to adapt to changing business needs.
3. **Detailed Analysis**: Fact tables provide granular data on specific events or transactions, while dimension tables offer rich context. This combination allows for detailed and insightful analysis, such as tracking user authentication patterns, understanding listening habits, or identifying trends in page views.

### Structure of This Document

In the following sections, the specific fact tables and dimension tables used in our data warehouse are explained. Each section includes:
- A description of the table's purpose.
- An explanation of the schema and key columns.
- The logic behind the table's design and its role in the overall data model.

By the end of this document, there will be a thorough understanding of how facts and dimensions work together to provide a robust framework for data analysis and reporting.
